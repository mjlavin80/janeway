Janeway is a journal platform designed for publishing scholarly research material. It is developed and maintained by the Centre for Technology and Publishing at Birkbeck, University of London.

# Technology
Janeway is written in Python (3.5+) and utilises the Django framework (1.11 LTS). 

# Installation instructions
Developer installation [instructions are available on our Wiki](https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/wiki/Installation).

A guide for installing on the live environment with [apache and mod_wsgi](https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/wiki/Janeway%2C-Apache-and-WSGI) is also available.

# Janeway design principles
1. No code should appear to work "by magic". Readability is key.

2. Testing will be applied to security modules and whenever a post-launch bugfix is committed. We do not aim for total testing but selective regression testing.

3. Security bugs jump the development queue and are a priority.

4. We will never accept commits of, or ourselves write, paywall features into Janeway.
