        <h1>Password Guide</h1>
        <p class="lead">When it comes to passwords, length is better than complexity.</p>
        <p>Its a common myth that a short and complex password (Jfjfy&65^87) is more secure than a long and uncomplicated password (our awesome moon base rocks).</p>
        <p>We recommend selecing a long, but easy to remember password such as <i>our awesome moon base rocks</i> which would take an estimated septillion years to crack as opposed to a complex one like <i>Jfjfy&65^87</i> which would take just over 600 years on a standard computer.</p>
